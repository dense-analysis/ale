<!--
  This is the template for reporting ALE bugs. Make sure you try updating ALE
  to a more recent version before reporting a bug. Look through existing bug
  reports for similar issues before reporting a new one. Don't leave comments
  about new bugs in the comment section for old issues.

  Make sure to try disabling other plugins and trying to repeat your bug before
  reporting it in ALE. Some times problems can arise when two plugins are used
  together, but often your issues might be problems with other plugins.
