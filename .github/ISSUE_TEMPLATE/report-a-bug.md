<!--
  This is the template for reporting ALE bugs. Make sure you try updating ALE
  to a more recent version before reporting a bug. Look through existing bug
  reports for similar issues before reporting a new one. Don't leave comments
  about new bugs in the comment section for old issues.

  Make sure to try disabling other plugins and trying to repeat your bug before
  reporting it in ALE. Some times problems can arise when two plugins are used
  together, but often your issues might be problems with other plugins.

## Information

**VIM version**

<!-- Paste just the first two lines of :version here. -->

## What went wrong

<!-- Describe what went wrong here. Be specific. -->

Something went wrong in specifically this place, and I also searched through both open and closed issues for the same problem before reporting a bug here.

Are you having trouble configuring ALE? Try asking for help on [Stack Exchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/) or perhaps on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) instead. The GitHub issue tracker should be used for reporting bugs or asking for new features.
