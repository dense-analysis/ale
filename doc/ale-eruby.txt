ALE Eruby Integration                                       *ale-eruby-options*

There are two linters for `eruby` files:

- `erubylint`
- `erubis`

If you don't know which one your project uses, it's probably `erb`.
To selectively enable one or the other, see |g:ale_linters|.

(Note that ALE already disables linters if the executable for that linter is
not found; thus, there's probably no need to disable one of these if you're
using the other one.)
