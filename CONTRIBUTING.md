# 1. Guidelines

Have fun, and work on whatever floats your boat. Take It Easy :tm:.

When writing code, follow the [Google Vimscript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/vimscriptguide.xml), and
run `vint -s` on your files to check for most of what the guide mentions and more. If you install this plugin and install
[Vint](https://github.com/Kuniwak/vint), it will check your code while you type.

# 2. Creating Pull Requests

For code you write, make sure to credit yourself at the top of files you add, and probably those you modify. You can write
some comments at the top of your VIM files.

```vim
" Author: John Smith <john.smith@gmail.com>
" Description: This file adds support for awesomelinter to the best language ever.
```

If you want to credit multiple authors, you can comma separate them.

```vim
" Author: John Smith <john.smith@gmail.com>, Jane Doe <https://jane-doe.info>
```

# 2.1. Adding a New Linter

If you add a new linter, look for existing handlers first in the [handlers.vim](autoload/ale/handlers.vim) file. One of the handlers
there may already be able to handle your lines of output. If you find that your new linter replicates an existing error handler,
consider pulling it up into the [handlers.vim](autoload/ale/handlers.vim) file, and use the generic handler in both places.

When you add a linter, make sure the language for the linter and the linter itself are present in the table in the
[README.md](README.md) file and in the Vim [help file](doc/ale.txt). The programs and linters are sorted alphabetically in the
table and list.

# 2.2. Adding New Options

If you add new options to the plugin, make sure to document those new options in the [README.md](README.md) file, and also
in the [help file](doc/ale.txt). Follow the format of other options in each. Global options should appear in the README
file, and in the relevant section in the help file, and options specific to a particular linter should go in the section
for that linter.

# 3. Compiling the Windows stdin wrapper

To compile the stdin wrapper program for Windows, when updating the D program, you will need to compile the program with
[LDC](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc) in release mode. Download and install the Community edition of Visual Studio
from [the Visual Studio website](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) first before installing LDC. LDC typically comes in
a ZIP you can just extract somewhere.

Make sure to compile with the 32-bit architecture flag, otherwise the EXE will not run on 32-bit machines.

```
ldc2 -m32 -Oz -release stdin_wrapper.d -of=stdin-wrapper.exe
```
