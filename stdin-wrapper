# Description: This script implements a wrapper for any program which does not accept
#   stdin input on most Unix machines. The input to the script is read to a
#   temporary file, and the first argument sets a particular file extension
#   for the temporary file.

# All of the following arguments are read as command to run.

# In perfect world it wouldn't be needed, but some tools (`go vet`, I am looking
# at you) do not fit in line and require filename ending. Otherwise it would be
# simple as
#
#     "$@" /dev/stdin
#
# without all that hackery with copying `/dev/stdin`
